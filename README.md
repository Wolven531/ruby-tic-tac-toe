# ruby-tic-tac-toe
The Game Tic-Tac-Toe in Ruby

## My Setup Process

1. Install Ruby and Ruby on Rails
    1. Get intro to Ruby via [Ruby in Twenty Minutes](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)
    1. Start setting up Rails environment
        1. Initially installed [this Bitnami](https://bitnami.com/stack/ruby/installer) bundle, but it did not appear to help
        1. Switched to [RailsInstaller](http://railsinstaller.org/en), but it came w/ the wrong version of Ruby ðŸ™„
        1. Ended up on the [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) page, and got Ruby + Devkit 2.7.2
        1. Also installed [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install), because Rails needs it
1. Create new Rails app w/ CLI
    1. `rails new tictactoe`
